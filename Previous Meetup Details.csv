October,2016-10-18,Di Cook,Monash University - Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics,Launch Meetup: The Role of R and Data Visualisation in Understanding Our World,"Frugal Guide to Quantitative Citizenship: The Role of R and Data Visualisation in Understanding Our World:In this technological age, we are drowning in data. Good data visualisation helps us to swim, digest the data, and learn about our world. The statistics community creates visualisation systems within the context of data analysis, so the graphics are designed to support and enrich the statistical processes of data exploration, modeling, and inference. With open data and open source software, the world is your oyster.   ",

February,2017-02-20,Natalia Da Silva,Iowa State University,"Learn About R Notebooks, aheatmap Package and Interactive Graphics","This talk describes structuring data and constructing plots to explore forest classification models interactively. A forest classifier is an example of an ensemble, produced by bagging multiple trees. The process of bagging and combining results from multiple trees, produces numerous diagnostics which with interactive graphics can provide a lot of insight into class structure in high dimensions. Various aspects are explored in this talk, to assess model complexity, individual model contributions, variable importance and dimension reduction, and uncertainty in prediction associated with individual observations. The ideas are applied to the random forest algorithm, and to the projection pursuit forest, but could be more broadly applied to other bagged ensembles. Interactive graphics are built in R, using ggplot2, plotly, and shiny packages.",
,,Jovana Maksimovic,Murdoch Childrens Research Institute,"Learn About R Notebooks, aheatmap Package and Interactive Graphics","As a bioinformatician, I analyse different types of high-dimensional data to answer biological questions. My work requires a lot of data exploration and is often highly iterative. R markdown has become indispensable for keeping my projects organised, reproducible and maintaining version control. However, when working with large datasets involving lots of plots, it was tedious to have to render an entire document to see the results of changes to a single plot. Alternatively, each plot had to be refined on its own, which was acceptable but could become error prone when preceding code was changed. The recent introduction of R notebooks in RStudio 1.0.0 has revolutionised how I work with R markdown. The ability to view plots/results in the source has made editing easy and robust, whilst retaining all the reproducibility and version control perks of traditional R markdown. My recent discovery of the aheatmap function in the NMF CRAN package has also made my life a lot easier by drastically simplifying the code require to create an informative heatmap.   ",
March,2017-03-30,Kaushik Lakshman,Betfair Australia,Building easy and interactive dashboards in R with flexdashboard,"Outputs of analyses or analytics pipelines often contain visualisations, summarised data and commentary around it. While this can be achieved using multiple methods such as good old fashioned Powerpoints, RMarkdowns or Shiny Apps; the good folks at R Studio have given analysts and data scientists a new alternative via a package called flexdashboard. Find out how easy it is to build flexible, attractive and interactive dashboards with R",
April,2017-04-27,Soroor Zadeh,The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research,Project Management and Version Control with Git in RStudio,"As a project evolves and more results are produced, a systematic way of keeping records of the changes to the analysis becomes vital. If you are developing a software or working on scripts in your day-to-day tasks, you would have realised that you need a tool that would allow you to keep track of all the changes you make to the project throughout the development process without requiring you to duplicate files and make copies of them. Such a tool would ideally also allow you to revert any recent changes to the script to the old ones or previous versions. This is called Version Control and Git is one such a tool that provides this facility. I will be introducing basic concepts in Version Control and demonstrate how to use Git in your routine analysis.",
May,2017-05-22,Anna Quaglieri + Saskia Freytag,The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research,Twitter Workshop,How to download and analyse Twitter data in R. As an example we download RuPaul's dragrace tweets that contains two widely used hastags and show how to work in R. We also include an example of how to make a wordcloud and sentiment analysis in R,
June,2017-06-15,Stephanie KovalchiK,Tennis Australia ,"Sports Analytics: scraping data from Web, tidy data, prediction models","What to know what it is like to be a sports statistician? In this talk I will provide a crash course of some common tools in R for conducting data science for sports. Typical activities of sports analysis include web scraping, data wrangling, machine learning, data visualisation, and blogging. I will show tools in R that can be used to tackle each of these steps and provide examples of their application with real-world sports examples.",
July,2017-07-27,Kristen Hunter,Harvard University,An evening with a Lady from HaRvard: building your first Neural Network with R and R debugging,"I will be giving two lightning talks. The first is on understanding the basic concepts of a neural network, and how to build a neural network in R. Next, I will discuss some underutilized R tools: the debug and profile functions. These built-in tools in Rstudio help you debug your code more easily and show you the bottlenecks in R scripts. I love interacting with the audience and answering questions, and I am also happy to discuss my experiences working in academia, data science, and software engineering.",
August,2017-08-24,Kim-Anh Le Cao,University Melbourne,,"The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available biological data coming from different sources. Combining such large-scale data sets can lead to the discovery of important insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner.

During this talk, I will introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. The toolkit provides a wide range of methods  to statistically integrate several data sets at once and probe relationships between heterogeneous data sets. mixOmics has been developed for ‘omics biological data (hence the name!) but the methods are applicable for other analytical problems where dimension reduction and data integration are required. I will relate my R journey through the development of the package and share tips and pitfalls to avoid when developing large R packages.",

September,2017-09-22,Nikki Rubinstein + Roxane Legaie, University Melbourne + Peter Mac,Workshop - Introduction to R,"Introduction to R for non-programmers.
The R-Ladies of Melbourne aim to create a friendly community for women who are interested in R statistical programming language in Melbourne through a series of seminar and hands-on R programming events.

This workshop will teach the fundamentals of R. You will learn to import, manipulate and plot data in R, using the RStudio environment. Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.

Third party packages are used during this workshop. These are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their usability.

These learning materials are a modified version of those used by Software Carpentry for their ""R for reproducible scientific analysis"" workshop: Greg Wilson: ""Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned"". F1000Research, 2016, 3:62 (doi: 10.12688/f1000research.3-62.v2).",
October,2017-10-25,Elizabeth Vogel,PhD student at the Australian-German Climate & Energy College at the University of Melbourne,"Random Forest, Climate Change and Food Production!","Abstract: Climate extreme events, such as droughts or heatwaves – have a severe impact on agricultural productivity worldwide. It is important to understand how such extreme events have affected global food production in the past in order to increase the resilience of the global food system to such events in the future. In this presentation, I will talk about how random forests - a machine learning algorithm - can help to detangle the complex interactions between climate and agricultural variables. In the first part of this presentation, I will introduce the concept of random forests, how they are used for regression and classification problems and how to build random forests in R using the randomForest package. In the second part I will talk about how I applied random forests to global climate and agricultural datasets to look at how climate extreme events affected agricultural production.",
November,2017-11-23,Marie Trussart + Soroor Zadeh,PostDoc WEHI + Master Student WEHI,Workshop - R Shiny Introduction ,"As massive high-dimensional data are being produced, fully interactive visualisation of these large data sets becomes critical to unravel the patterns from large complexities. It also permits the user to play with the data and make the information more understandable. In addition, interactive data manipulation enables to study the behaviour of a mathematical model, as the parameters of the model are being modified which can be helpful for example in developing interactive education materials.It is even used by newspapers like the New York Times and scientific papers like Science. R shiny is an excellent framework to turn an R analysis into an interactive web application and we will be presenting a two-hour introductory workshop to build interactive apps with R Shiny. In this workshop, we will cover the structure of R Shiny Apps, and the concept of reactivity, where an 'event' such as changing the value of the input or selecting a row in a table, triggers a set of reactions and results in updating the output value. We will also briefly talk about ways to publish and distribute an app publicly.",
